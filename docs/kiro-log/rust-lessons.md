# Rust lesson: repo-skeleton T03

The workspace manifest gives every crate the same Rust edition, version, and lint rules.
A workspace keeps related packages buildable together while preserving their boundaries.
The six package names are explicit, so Cargo cannot silently add an alternate architecture.
The initial source files are intentionally tiny so later tasks can add one responsibility at a time.
# Rust lesson: repo-skeleton T04

Rust libraries can expose small constants and types without owning a process or runtime.
A crate boundary is useful documentation: `common` shares data, while `engine` stays pure.
Keeping dependencies out of these manifests prevents future sandbox concerns from leaking into them.
Doc comments become generated API documentation and explain the ownership boundary to reviewers.
# Rust lesson: repo-skeleton T05

A binary crate starts at `main`, while a library crate exposes reusable Rust APIs.
Grimoire keeps its library and `validate` command in one package, which avoids a second crate boundary.
An empty `main` is still a deliberate process boundary; it does not imply that untrusted code is safe to run.
Later async and trait work belongs in the judge and MCP specs, not in these placeholders.
# Rust lesson: repo-skeleton T06

No Rust code changed in T06; the frontend is intentionally independent of the server crate.
The server will consume the generated `web/build` directory later rather than starting npm at runtime.
Keeping the build artifact separate lets the Rust process remain the only production web server.
# Rust lesson: repo-skeleton T08

`Result` lets startup report configuration, bind, and server errors instead of hiding them.
The `?` operator returns an error early while preserving the normal success path.
`Router` owns route composition, and `Json<Value>` serializes the health response without hand-building JSON.
Tokio supplies the async runtime and listener, while Axum handles HTTP routing on top of it.
